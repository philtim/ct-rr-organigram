 * The only module that pulls in `write-excel-file` (ADR-010).

 * never carries a spreadsheet writer it has no use for. Keep this file free of
 * anything but the write call for the same reason: whatever is imported here
 * is imported with the library.
 *
 * Its zip backend is redirected to a synchronous one in `vite.config.ts`,
 * because the host's CSP refuses the Web Worker the asynchronous one spawns
 * (ADR-012, `./fflate-sync.ts`).
